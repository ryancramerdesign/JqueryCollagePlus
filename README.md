# CollagePlus for ProcessWire

[CollagePlus](http://ed-lea.github.io/jquery-collagePlus/) is a jQuery plugin by Ed Lea. 
It takes a list of images and converts it to a nicely formatted grid.
With this module, we use the CollagePlus plugin to produce nice grid output for 
ProcessWire image selection. This applies to the images that you select when 
clicking the image icon from the rich text editor (TinyMCE or CKEditor). The idea for
this is from the great [Unify admin theme](http://mods.pw/4p) for ProcessWire.
To use, simply install the module and it is ready to go.

The idea for this usage (in the admin image selection) is by
[adamspruijt](http://modules.processwire.com/authors/adamspruijt/),
as he made use of it in his [Unify](http://mods.pw/4p) admin theme.
I wanted to use the same output in other admin themes, so this 
module was the result.
